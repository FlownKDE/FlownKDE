## ü§î **Why use Flown to install Plasma KDE ?**

This utility is designed to make running Plasma KDE on ChromeOS devices significantly easier by automating the entire process. It ensures everything is handled efficiently, saving you time and effort while delivering faster and more reliable results compared to manual methods.

## üëÄ **Why use Plasma KDE on my ChromeOS device ?**

### ‚úè **Better customization**

The default ChromeOS desktop often leaves much to be desired, whereas KDE Plasma provides a highly customizable desktop environment tailored to your specific needs

### ü™ü **Advanced Window Management**

With features like automatic window tiling, snapping, and advanced virtual desktop management, KDE Plasma dramatically improves productivity by allowing optimal organization of your workspace.

### üîß **Ecosystem rich in tools**

KDE Plasma includes a wide range of built-in tools and applications, such as the Dolphin file manager, Elisa media player, package manager, and more, providing a complete experience without requiring external applications.

## üîÆ **The Future of Flown**

The project is fully functional, and I will soon announce the conditions that must be met for Flown KDE to enter the **Release Candidate (RC)** phase.

- Full support for themes and other customization features is in place, although some customization options are still not fully operational.
- The installation process has been significantly improved, with clearer indications to distinguish between the download and installation stages. (It's coming VERY SOON!)

Despite my limited time, I will do my best to stay as active as possible to complete the Flown project and finalize it under the best possible conditions.

## üì¶ **Installation**

### 1. Prerequisites

- Ensure your ChromeOS version is **88 or later** before proceeding.
- If you haven‚Äôt already installed Linux on your ChromeOS device, follow Google‚Äôs official instructions **[here](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439?hl=fr)** to enable Linux development tools.
